  * Update examples to use log instead of print
  * Defer to thread
  * Pooling, context managers.. EEK!

Future
  * Write tests, somehow--check out twisted.trial
  * Test/fix WSGI stuff
  * Error handling and callback existence, response/no response conventions, client
  * Exception handling in the stack.. doesn't work well!
