 * Tests
 * Memory leak checks on load of various kinds, protocols, etc
 * Client traceback niceties
 * More client/pool failure mode investigation
 * Docs of diesel patterns etc
 * More helpers, ala queue?  Async-like patterns outlined?  yield Loop, wait or bytes
 * AMQP helpers to make RPC-ish patterns easier
 * AMQP - wrap up a few more messages in (failures, etc) and doc completeness
 * Protocols: Tests for HTTP, mongodb, redis, AMQP
 * Update docstrings and website docs
